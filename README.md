<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

In partnership with [Ruby for Good CASA](https://github.com/rubyforgood/casa) (Court Appointed Special Advocate), [Code the Change YYC](https://www.codethechangeyyc.ca/) is creating an IOS app that allows CASA volunteers to conveniently save their case contacts.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Run the following command to ensure node is installed on your device

```
npm -v
```
If the npm command is not recognized, please install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
<br />
<br />
Install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#debian-stable)
```
npm install --global yarn
```

Additionally, if you have an IOS device, download the [Expo Go](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) app for previewing. Otherwise, [Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/) is expo's official web-based alternative.

### Installation
1. Create [your own fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of this repository and clone that repository to a directory on your local computer
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/casa-ios-ctc.git
```

2. Install expo-cli 
```
npm i -g expo-cli
```

3. Run the application
 ```
 npx expo start
 ```

  You should now have a React Native / Typescript app running on
  the localhost address displayed within your terminal. A QR code should also appear. 
  <br />
  <br />
  To preview the application, scan the QR code on your iphone or import your forked repo into [Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/) by clicking the 3 dots to the right of "Project"

  ## ✨ Extra
  
  Now that the project is set up, you can contribute to it! :)
  To ensure everything is working as it should, create an initial "landing pull request" this should be a small change such as adding an emoji or a greeting to the main page.
  - Within your local repo, run ```git status``` to ensure you're on the ```main``` branch
  - Create a seperate branch within your local repo with ```git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH_NAME```
  - Make your addition(s). Ensure that the edited files are added with 
  ```git add CHANGED_FILE```, run ```git status``` often
  - Then, after every few changes, commit with ```git commit -m " YOUR COMMIT DESCRIPTION "```
  - Finally, ensuring my repo is set as the upstream, ```git push``` the changes to your fork and make a pull request to this repo that resolves one of the     "Landing/Onboarding Pull Request's"
  
  Congrats, you are now an open source developer 😎
